This recipe was created in order to push the downloaded GitHub Desktop app into the /Applications/Development directory on my machines, instead of just into the Applications directory.

Since this involves changing processes, my understanding is that this cannot just be done by an override.

I borrowed from the DetectX swift recipe to figure out how to do this.
