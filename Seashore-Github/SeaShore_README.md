This is by way of a test of my understanding.

There was a previous recipe for Seashore (give credit), but it was for the older version hosted on SourceForge that still needed Xwindow. The current version is hosted on GitHub
and is Mac native.

I took the Handbrake recipes (give credit) as that was a package based on GitHub too, and have edited them to try to make them work.

I could not figure out how to host the recipes on my own computer and import them into AutoPkg, so the simplest thing seemed to be to host them on GItHub too,
and to import them that way.  I had been going to keep the repo private while I was practising but I think I am going to have to make it public for simplicity too.
