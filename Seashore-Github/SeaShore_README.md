This is by way of a test of my understanding.

There were previous recipes for Seashore (ahousseini/jessepeterson), but they were for the older version hosted on SourceForge that still needed Xwindow. The current version is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/robaho/seashore)
and is Mac native.

I took the Handbrake recipes (Handbrake/Handbrake.munki.recipe ) as that was a package based on GitHub too, and have edited them to try to make them work.

I could not immediately see how to host the recipes on my own computer and import them into AutoPkg, so the simplest thing seemed to be to host them on GitHub too,
and to import them that way.  I had been going to keep the repo private while I was practising but I think I am going to have to make it public for simplicity too.

Anyway, to my own amazement, this does seem to work.  Clearly only tested with the current version of Seashore so I have not witnessed updates working, but if this helps anyone, you're welcome.
